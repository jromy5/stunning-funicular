# POST-COMMIT HOOK
#
# The post-commit hook is invoked after a commit. Subversion runs
# this hook by invoking a program (script, executable, binary,
# etc.) named `post-commit' (for which
# this file is a template) with the following ordered arguments:
#
#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#   [2] REV          (the number of the revision just committed)
#
# Because the commit has already completed and cannot be undone,
# the exit code of the hook program is ignored.  The hook program
# can use the `svnlook' utility to help it examine the
# newly-committed tree.
#
# On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have `post-commit'
# invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
# work itself too.
#
# Note that `post-commit' must be executable by the user(s) who will
# invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
# have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
#
# On a Windows system, you should name the hook program
# `post-commit.bat' or `post-commit.exe',
# but the basic idea is the same.
# 
# Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter:

SVNSYNC=/usr/bin/svnsync
SUDO=/usr/local/bin/sudo
MAILER=/usr/bin/svn-mailer
SETLOCK=/root/bin/setlock.pl
MASTER_HOSTNAME=<%= @svn_master_hostname %>
HOSTNAME=`/bin/hostname -f`

REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"

if [ "$HOSTNAME" = "$MASTER_HOSTNAME" ]
then

    #/usr/local/svn/bin/svnadmin dump --incremental -r "$REV" "$REPOS" > /x1/svn/backups/tck/tck.$REV

    # send the commit mail
    $MAILER --commit --config=/x1/svn/asf-mailer.conf --repository=$REPOS --revision=$REV \
        2>>/var/log/svnmailer/errors/tck-mailer-stderr &

    # sync the mirrors!
