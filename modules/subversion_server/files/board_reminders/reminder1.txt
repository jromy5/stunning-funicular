Subject: ASF Board Report - Initial Reminder for [month] [year]

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the ASF Board.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare the report.

The meeting is scheduled for [meetingDate] and the deadline for
submitting your report is 1 full week prior to that ([dueDate])!

According to board records, you are listed as the chair of at least one
committee that is due to submit a report this month. [1] [2]

Details on which project reports are due and how to submit a report 
are enclosed below.

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the board members
to review and digest. Again, the very latest you should submit your report
is 1 full week (7days) prior to the board meeting ([dueDate]).

If you feel that an error has been made, please consult [1] and if there
is still an issue then contact the board directly.

As always, PMC chairs are welcome to attend the board meeting.

Thanks,
The ASF Board

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Full details about the process and schedule are in [1].

The report should be committed to the meeting agenda in the board directory
in the foundation repository, trying to keep a similar format to the others.
This can be found at:

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/board

Your report should also be sent in plain-text format to [whoTo]
with a Subject line that follows the below format:

            Subject: [REPORT] Project Name

Cutting and pasting directly from a Wiki is not acceptable due to formatting
issues. Line lengths should be limited to 77 characters.

Chairs may use the Apache Reporter Service [4] to help them compile and
submit a board report.


Resolutions
-----------

There are several templates for use for various Board resolutions.
They can be found in [3] and you are encouraged to use them. It is
strongly recommended that if you have a resolution before the board,
you are encouraged to attend that board meeting.
