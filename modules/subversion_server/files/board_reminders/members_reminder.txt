Subject: Reminder: ASF Board Meeting, [meetingDate]

Fellow ASF members,

The monthly board meeting is held on the third Wednesday of each
month. This month's meeting will be held on [meetingDate]:

    [tdUrl]

Detailed information about this meeting, including phone and IRC details,
is in svn, in the directory:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/board

along with minutes from previous meetings. If you plan to attend, add your
name to the 'Guests' section of that file. All members are welcome to
attend.

Please leave your phone on mute, and speak only when invited to do so.

You can follow along with the agenda at:

    https://whimsy.apache.org/board/agenda/

Board meetings are a great opportunity to get a broader view of what's
happening at the foundation, outside of the projects you're directly
involved in. Even if you can't attend the meeting, you are strongly
encouraged to read the reports submitted by the various projects, which are
also included in the document referenced above, and also at:

    http://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/.

A reminder: These reports sometimes contain confidential information,
designated in the agenda file by <private>, which MUST NOT be shared
outside of the foundation. A meeting summary is posted to the
committers@apache.org mailing list shortly after the meeting, and the
minutes are published to the ASF website, at:

    http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar.html

once they're approved - which usually happens in the next month's board
meeting.
