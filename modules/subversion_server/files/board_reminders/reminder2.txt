Subject: ASF Board Report for [month] [year] is now due

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the
ASF Board.

According to board records, you are listed as the chair of at least one
committee that is due to submit a report this month. These reports are
now due and should be submitted to the board as soon as possible
but no later that [dueDate].

The meeting is scheduled for [meetingDate].

Full details about the process and schedule are in [1].

The report should be committed to the meeting agenda in the board directory
in the foundation repository, trying to keep a similar format to the others.
This can be found at:

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/board

Your report should also be sent in plain-text format to [whoTo]
with a Subject line that follows the below format:

            Subject: [REPORT] Project Name

Cutting and pasting directly from a Wiki is not acceptable due to formatting
issues. Line lengths should be limited to 77 characters.

Chairs may use the Apache Reporter Service [3] to help them compile and
submit a board report.

As always, PMC chairs are welcome to attend the board meeting.

Thanks,
The ASF Board
