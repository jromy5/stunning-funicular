Board Reminders
===============

The 'reminders.pl' script reads the file committee-info.txt file that is maintained in
the committers repository in the board directory. The file is parsed and
email reminders are sent to those who are listed as being the committee
chairs. There is actually the capability to have 2 reminders, 
one an initial "heads up" and then a second "reminder". The date that 
the script is run determines which reminder is sent. The date can be 
controlled by setting the 'finalDate' variable (defaults to 14).

Usage
-----

The files needed are located in the infrastructure repository, which is only accessible
via https.

To issue the reminders for the first time (checking the files out into a directory shown
by <directory>) the following commands may be used.

cd <directory>
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure-puppet.git
cd infrastructure-puppet/modules/subversion_server/files/board_reminders
./reminders.pl

To issue the reminders subsequently, the following can then be used.

cd <directory>/board_reminders
git pull
./reminders.pl

Testing
-------

To run the script without sending any email:

./reminders.pl --no-email

A number of other options exist - check the script help or source code for
more information.

Issues
------

The biggest issue is how we get the file from svn. Presently this script
needs to be run in an interactive mode and username/password entered
as it uses an https url. Ideally we'd use svnlook but there are concerns
about using this against the repository until it is converted to use
fsfs as it's backend. According to Sander using it against a repository
using the bdb backend can lead to hanging of the repository.

The exact licence that covers the committed CPAN module (File::Slurp) isn't obvious,
nor has it been possible to determine through online searches. We should probably
contact the author and ensure that it's not GPL'd.
